# My Personal Ramblings
Those who know me will tell you that I'm not a massive fan of writing, but whether it's software engineering, photography/videography, woodworking, or something that incorporates them all, I'm usually knee-deep in one project or another.

I decided it's about time that I start to record my progress, achievements, and failures, so I added this blog to my site. Here, you'll find a collection of my informal notes and thoughts. They might not be the most polished or well-written pieces, but I'm hoping that something in here can be of use to someone else. The articles are split up into different topics, so whether you're here to find something specific or just to see what I'm up to, pick a topic and jump in!
