# NV7 PC Build
I've always loved building computers, and a water-cooled build has always been on my todo list. However, the timing never seemed right, until Phanteks unveiled their latest NV7 case. I was immediately sold and what a perfect case to highlight a water-cooled PC. 

This time around, I was eager to create something distinct and one-of-a-kind. I knew I wanted the case to have some sort of screen and I've been having a lot of fun with the LEDs on the arcade machine recently so I wanted to see if I could do something fancy with the case lighting.

_I'm still working on this case so check back for updates later_
