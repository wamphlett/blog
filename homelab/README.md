# Home Lab
They say the best way to learn how to swim is to jump in the deep end, right? Sure, you can learn things like Networking, Security and Kubernetes as part of your day job as a developer but there's no manual that can teach you better than having to start from scratch and configure everything yourself to make it all work. So, here I am, diving in headfirst into the deep end.

My "lab" has evolved over the years. I started out with a crappy router and a bare metal ubuntu server running [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/) and over the years I have acquired more hardware to make things more robust. I'm currently running a fully managed Unifi network, [K3S](https://k3s.io/) on top of [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) nodes and Synology for network storage.

Many years have passed since I set off down this path but I will do my best to document the interesting things from here on.
