# My Wesbites
I have a few webites and I tend to tinker with them from time to time. Over the years, my personal site has been either a simple HTML site, a more dynamic ReactJS site and even an experimental one that used Flutter for Web. 

Today, my portfolio sites include three independently managed NextJS sites. Firstly, there's [my portfolio site](https://warrenamphlett.co.uk/), a brief introduction to me. Then, there's [a site](https://photos.warrenamphlett.co.uk/) dedicated to the collections of photos which I cant seem to stop taking. And lastly, there's this blog â€“ a chronicle of my adventures in software development amongst other things that peak my interest. As well as these sites, I have a public library which serves all of the content for these sites and anything else which might need it. 

Each one of these projects has a few quirks which makes them slightly more interesting than a normal site so I'll do my best to explain what I've done and why.
